# gridart

A small collection of explorations in making grids of circles.

```
python3 image.py
```
This takes an image, resizes it to 100 pixels wide, and then coverts each pixel to four circles: one red, one blue, two green. This is a rough recreation of the regular display of pixels on a screen.
